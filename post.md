##1. Introduction

Welcome back to our 2014 Authors! We've been hard at work building, testing and polishing our shiny new **social authoring system**, complete with **GitHub integration** and **5 star ratings**, and we're finally ready to show it to the world. 

In fact, **we're giving away $100 dollars to the first 10 authors who [create a post](https://www.airpair.com/posts/new) and submit it for review. **

Below you'll find a quick explanation of how it works. 

*If you're keen to try it out, feel free to skip my explanation. Just [create a post](https://www.airpair.com/posts/new), or [fork this one](https://www.airpair.com/posts/fork/54e799a2ebda560c005c3034) to see for yourself. *

##2. Writing Process

The writing process now takes place in three steps:

###2.1. Draft your Post

We've drastically improved the content editor. You are still writing in markdown, but now code blocks are the same as github flavored fenced code blocks. 

Take it for a spin and see your changes as you type. Remember to save your changes as you go.

####2.2.1 Receive Feedback
